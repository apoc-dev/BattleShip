# battleship
 Basically battleship but with smart ship placement

Implemented a logic to always place as many ships as possible. (tried to use backtracking)


## How-to
Change the following vars to configure the game.
In DEBUG Mode you can try the placeShips method without actually playing the game.

    final int shipLength = 3;
    final int fieldSize = 5;
    final int numberOfShipsToPlace = 8;

    final boolean DEBUG = true;
    final boolean START_GAME = false;
